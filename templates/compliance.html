		<h3 class="procedure-title" id="entrance">Vessel Entrance and Cruising Permits</h3>
  		<p>There are two main ways a foreign vessel may clear into USA waters, either a formal entrance in which the yacht deposits the ship’s original registration, or obtains a cruising permit.  While a cruising permit is the top choice for most vessels, there are certain stipulations which must be met in order to have a cruising permit approved.  Deposit of registration is extremely straight forward, and can be completed by just about any foreign flagged vessel.  We explore both of these procedures below.</p>

	<h3>Cruising Permit</h3>
    <p>Cruising permits are approved to foreign vessels which meet the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vessel is operating on a private registration - not commercial</li>
        <li>Vessel is not actively offered for charter</li>
        <li>Vessel was built in the USA</li>
        <li>Owner is a USA citizen or has bonafide residence in the USA</li>
        <li>Owning company is registered in the USA</li>
        <li>Vessel has a preliminary itinerary cruising USA waters and several USA ports</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Deposit of Registration</h3>
		<p>Foreign vessels who do not qualify for a cruising permit, must file what is known as a CBP 1300 form, and deposit the ship’s original registration with the port office.  When the vessel is ready to depart, another CBP 1300 is filed, and the original registration is retrieved from the port office.  Once the outbound clearance is filed, the vessel has 48 hours in which to depart.</p>

  <h3>ENOAd</h3>
		<p>Electronic Notice of Arrival and Departure is an electronic system which was set in place after Nine Eleven.  This is monitored by the National Vessel Movement Center, a collaboration between the US Coast Guard, and Customs and Border Patrol.  Foreign vessels entering USA waters, must file an arrival notice prior to their entrance.  While this is mandatory for vessels over 300 Gross Tons, it is strongly recommended for all foreign vessels.  For voyages greater than 24 hours, submission must be made 96 hours prior.  Voyages less than 24 hours, must be submitted 48 hours prior.  Departure submissions can be filed up to the time of departure, but 24 hours prior is recommend.</p>

			<h3>Visas</h3>
				<p>All foreign crew arriving into the USA, either on a yacht, or by plane, are required to have a valid visa.  Visas accepted for employed yacht crew are either a B1/B2 or C1D.  If you are arriving on your personal vessel, you may enter on an ESTA visa.  The table below indicates general information for visas, including the ships registration, and amount of time you may be stamped into the USA.</p>
        <div class="table-visa">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th class="text-align-right">B1/B2</th>
              <th class="text-align-center">C1D</th>
              <th class="text-align-left">ESTA</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="text-align-right">Private Registration</td>
              <td class="text-align-center">Commercial Registration</td>

			<h3>Immigration Procedures</h3>
				<p>In 2018, US Customs and Border Protection launched the CBP Roam App, this replaces the former procedure of calling Customs and getting an arrival number, after which the crew would attend the closet immigration office and be stamped in.  This App simplifies the process and reduces time immensely.</p>

			<h3>Joining Crew</h3>
        <p>It is important to understand, if a foreign crew changes vessel of employment, it is highly recommend that crew member leave the USA, and return under the new vessel’s documentation.</p>
        <p>When joining a new vessel, the documents are recommend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Joining Letter from the vessel or shoreside agent</li>
